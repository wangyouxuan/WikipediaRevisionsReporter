## Challenge #1 Complete

I made changes the code bind(QueryEngine.class).to(FakeQueryEngine.class) to bind(QueryEngine.class).to(WikipediaQueryEngine.class). Since the first default application configuration uses FakeQueryEngine to simulate the network, I only need to change it to FakeQueryEngine so that the application uses the real WikipediaQueryEngine instead.

## Challenge #2 Complete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #2. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Challenge #3 Complete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #3. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

(Write one or more paragraphs comparing and contrasting the iterative and functional  
approaches to string concatenation you explored in challenge #3. Which do you
prefer, and why?)

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

(Explain how polymorphism engendered dependency inversion in this little
application. Be clear and precise here, as this is, in part, an assessment of
your correct use of technical terminology.
Consider, for example, where exactly is polymorphism used?
Where exactly is a dependency inverted?)
